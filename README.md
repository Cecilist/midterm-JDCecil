## Project Report
I wanted to use this project as kind of a redo of my project 2. I really wasn't proud of where my first platforming game ended up, so from the start I knew I wanted to make a platformer. The first goal I had was get the movement just right. I'm not sure if what I have here would hold up in some AAA platformer game, but it feels a lot better than what I had before. After that I brainstormed a bit on what kind of platformer to make. My first idea was to incorperate the theme of "half-way there" and have any collectibles start as showing half being collected. From there my thinking went towards mountains. I've always seen mountains as a good analogy for progress. So I thought starting the player half-way up a mountain would be a nice call back to the theme. Then I had flashbacks to project 2, where quickly found out slopes cause intersting bugs with movement. So, I decided to take inspiration from a trope I remember encountering often as a kid, where the main character has to esacpe a volcano before it erupts. I could represent the inside of a volcano without any slopes!  

I believe I've met all the requirements for an A.
